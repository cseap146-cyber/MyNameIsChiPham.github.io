        <h2>Who I Am</h2>

        <p>
            Most people call me Chelsea. I am an undergraduate 
            Business Economics student at York University, 
            interested in how markets, incentives, and human behavior shape 
            decision making. I enjoy analyzing problems, understanding how 
            people and businesses respond to change, and finding practical, 
            data-driven solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
           Outside of academics, I work as a Barista at Starbucks. Working in a fast 
           paced, high volume environment has taught me how to stay calm under 
           pressure, multitask efficiently, and communicate clearly with both customers 
           and my team. It also gives me a real-world perspective on concepts like 
           pricing, demand, labor, and operations ideas that connect directly back to 
           what I study in economics. 
           
           Curious, hardworking, and eager to learn, I’m always looking for ways to 
           grow, whether that’s building new skills, taking on challenges, or better 
           understanding the world through an economic lens.
        </p>
